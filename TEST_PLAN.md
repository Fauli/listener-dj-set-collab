## Frontend Tests (Currently Missing)

### 🔴 P0: Core Utility Functions

#### 1. Camelot Key Utilities (`src/client/utils/camelotKey.ts`)

**Why critical**: Harmonic mixing is core to DJ workflow. Wrong key matching = bad mixes.

- [ ] **parseCamelotKey()**
  - [ ] Valid keys: "1A" through "12A", "1B" through "12B"
  - [ ] Invalid format: "13A", "0A", "1C", "A1", "abc"
  - [ ] Case insensitivity: "8a" should parse as "8A"
  - [ ] Null/undefined handling
  - [ ] Whitespace trimming: " 8A " should work

- [ ] **areKeysCompatible()**
  - [ ] Same key: "8A" + "8A" → true
  - [ ] Adjacent same letter: "8A" + "7A" → true, "8A" + "9A" → true
  - [ ] Wrapping: "1A" + "12A" → true, "12A" + "1A" → true
  - [ ] Relative (A/B swap): "8A" + "8B" → true
  - [ ] Incompatible: "8A" + "10A" → false, "8A" + "5B" → false
  - [ ] Null/undefined handling

- [ ] **getCompatibleKeys()**
  - [ ] Returns 4 keys for valid input (same, +1, -1, opposite letter)
  - [ ] Wrapping at boundaries: getCompatibleKeys("1A") includes "12A"
  - [ ] Wrapping at boundaries: getCompatibleKeys("12A") includes "1A"
  - [ ] Empty array for invalid input

- [ ] **getKeyRelationship()**
  - [ ] Returns 'same', 'adjacent', 'relative' correctly
  - [ ] Returns null for incompatible keys

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

---

#### 2. Beat Detection (`src/client/utils/beatDetection.ts`)

**Why critical**: Auto-BPM detection is key feature. Inaccurate = manual fixes needed.

- [ ] **detectBeats() - Edge Cases**
  - [ ] Empty/silent audio buffer → should throw meaningful error
  - [ ] Very short audio (< 2 seconds) → should handle gracefully
  - [ ] Extremely low BPM (< 80) → should detect or throw
  - [ ] Extremely high BPM (> 180) → should detect or throw
  - [ ] Irregular beats (live recordings) → should handle gracefully

- [ ] **detectBeats() - Parameter Validation**
  - [ ] maxDuration limits analysis time correctly
  - [ ] minBpm/maxBpm filters work correctly
  - [ ] sensitivity affects threshold properly

- [ ] **calculateRMS() - Internal Logic**
  - [ ] Window size edge cases (last window partial)
  - [ ] Zero energy windows

**Note**: These tests will need mock AudioBuffer objects. May need to create test fixtures.

**Estimated effort**: 4-5 hours (including mock setup)

---

#### 3. Beat Grid Utilities (`src/client/utils/beatGrid.ts`)

**Why important**: Affects visual waveform alignment.

- [ ] Check if file exists and has complex logic
- [ ] Add tests for boundary conditions

**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours

---

#### 4. Set Playtime Calculator (`src/client/utils/setPlaytime.ts`)

- [ ] Check if file exists
- [ ] Test total playtime calculations
- [ ] Test with missing/null BPM values
- [ ] Test with empty playlist

**Estimated effort**: 1 hour

---

### 🟡 P1: State Management (Zustand Stores)

#### 5. Playlist Store (`src/client/stores/playlistStore.ts`)

**Why important**: Central to collaborative editing. Position bugs = broken playlist.

- [ ] **addTrack()**
  - [ ] Adds track and maintains sorted order
  - [ ] Duplicate positions handled correctly
  - [ ] Empty playlist → first track

- [ ] **removeTrack()**
  - [ ] Removes correct track
  - [ ] Recalculates positions for remaining tracks
  - [ ] Remove from empty playlist → no error
  - [ ] Remove non-existent track → no error

- [ ] **updateTrack()**
  - [ ] Updates correct track
  - [ ] Partial updates work (only note, only cuePoints)
  - [ ] Update non-existent track → no error

- [ ] **reorderTrack()**
  - [ ] Move to beginning (position 0)
  - [ ] Move to end (last position)
  - [ ] Move to middle
  - [ ] Invalid positions handled
  - [ ] All other tracks maintain correct order

- [ ] **Optimistic Updates**
  - [ ] addPendingAction / removePendingAction work
  - [ ] isPending returns correct state
  - [ ] Pending actions don't block UI

- [ ] **reset()**
  - [ ] Clears all state including pending actions

**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

---

#### 6. Deck Store (`src/client/stores/deckStore.ts`)

**Prerequisites**: Install testing libraries first
```bash
npm install -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom
```

**Vitest config**: Add to `vitest.config.ts`:
```typescript
test: {
  environment: 'jsdom',
  setupFiles: ['./tests/setupTests.ts'],
}
```

**Estimated effort**: 1 hour setup

---

  - [ ] Renders tracks in correct order
  - [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering
  - [ ] Click handlers work

- [ ] **AddTrackForm.tsx** - Track input
  - [ ] Form validation
  - [ ] Submit with valid data
  - [ ] Error handling

- [ ] **CuePoints.tsx** - Cue point editor
  - [ ] Displays cue points
  - [ ] Updates on change
  - [ ] Validates time values

- [ ] **LoginPage.tsx** - Auth flow
  - [ ] Renders login options
  - [ ] Handles OAuth redirect

**Estimated effort**: 6-8 hours for all components

---

## Backend Tests (Edge Cases)

### 🔴 P0: Concurrency & Race Conditions

#### 9. SetEntry Retry Logic (`src/server/models/SetEntry.ts`)

**Why critical**: Multiple DJs can add tracks simultaneously. Position conflicts must resolve correctly.

- [ ] **addTrackToPlaylist() - Concurrent Inserts**
  - [ ] Two clients add track at same position simultaneously
  - [ ] Retry logic works (up to MAX_RETRIES)
  - [ ] All retries exhausted → throws meaningful error
  - [ ] Transaction rollback on failure

- [ ] **Performance Test**
  - [ ] Large playlist (100+ tracks) - shift performance
  - [ ] Insert at position 0 (worst case - shifts all)

**How to test**: Use Promise.all() to simulate concurrent operations

**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

---

#### 10. Track Reordering Under Concurrency

- [ ] **reorderSetEntry() - Concurrent Reorders**
  - [ ] Two DJs reorder different tracks simultaneously
  - [ ] Two DJs reorder same track simultaneously
  - [ ] Reorder while another DJ is adding track
  - [ ] Final state is consistent (no duplicate positions)

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 hours

---

### 🟡 P1: WebSocket Edge Cases

#### 11. WebSocket Connection Lifecycle

**Why important**: Network issues are common. Need graceful handling.

- [ ] **Rapid connect/disconnect**
  - [ ] Client connects and immediately disconnects
  - [ ] Reconnect with same userId after disconnect
  - [ ] Session cleanup happens correctly

- [ ] **Concurrent state updates**
  - [ ] Multiple clients emit updates simultaneously
  - [ ] Room state stays consistent
  - [ ] All clients receive correct final state

- [ ] **Network interruption simulation**
  - [ ] Client loses connection mid-session
  - [ ] Reconnection restores state
  - [ ] Old sessions are cleaned up

**Estimated effort**: 4-5 hours

---

#### 12. Room State Synchronization

- [ ] **Large room state (50+ tracks)**
  - [ ] room:state message size reasonable
  - [ ] Performance is acceptable

- [ ] **User list updates**
  - [ ] 5+ users join/leave rapidly
  - [ ] User list stays accurate for all clients

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours

---

### 🟡 P1: File Upload Edge Cases

#### 13. Upload Validation (`src/server/routes/uploads.ts`)

- [ ] **Corrupted files**
  - [ ] Invalid MP3 header → proper error
  - [ ] Truncated file → proper error
  - [ ] Non-audio file with .mp3 extension → rejected

- [ ] **File size limits**
  - [ ] Exactly at limit → accepted
  - [ ] Just over limit → rejected with clear error
  - [ ] Very large file (100MB+) → fails gracefully

- [ ] **Concurrent uploads**
  - [ ] Multiple users upload to same room
  - [ ] Filenames don't collide
  - [ ] All files stored correctly

**Estimated effort**: 3 hours

---

### 🟢 P2: Data Integrity

#### 14. Database Constraints & Cascades

- [ ] **Foreign key handling**
  - [ ] Delete room → cascades to setEntries
  - [ ] Delete user → handles gracefully
  - [ ] Delete track with active setEntries → prevents or cascades?

- [ ] **Unique constraints**
  - [ ] roomId + position uniqueness enforced
  - [ ] Concurrent violations handled

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours

---

#### 15. Session Cleanup & Orphan Prevention

- [ ] **cleanupOldSessions()** (if implemented)
  - [ ] Cleans sessions older than threshold
  - [ ] Doesn't clean active sessions
  - [ ] Handles empty database

- [ ] **Orphaned records**
  - [ ] Tracks with no setEntries → cleanup strategy
  - [ ] SetEntries with deleted tracks → should not exist

**Estimated effort**: 2 hours

---

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

## Notes

- **Parallel work**: Frontend and backend tests can be written in parallel
- **Mock data**: Need to create audio buffer mocks for beat detection tests
- **CI/CD**: Should add GitHub Actions workflow once tests are in place
- **Performance**: May need separate performance test suite if these get slow

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Beat detection testing**: Do we have sample audio files in repo, or create synthetic ones?
2. **Component testing**: Which component library is being used (React + shadcn/ui)?
3. **WebSocket reconnection**: Is there reconnection logic in the client already?
4. **File storage**: Where are uploaded files stored (local, S3)? Affects upload tests.
