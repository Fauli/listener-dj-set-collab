## Project: Listener — Collaborative Real-Time DJ Playlist Tool

### 🎧 Vision

Listener is a **real-time collaborative DJ set planner** for DJs who want to prepare their sets together remotely.  
Two DJs can connect, share their music ideas, and build a cohesive set — track by track — in sync.  
They can reorder tracks, annotate transitions, add cue points, and see all changes live.

The goal: make collaborative DJ planning as natural and dynamic as performing together.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

1. **Real-time collaboration** — every update is instantly visible to all participants.
2. **Simplicity first** — no playback, no file uploads, just efficient planning.
3. **History-aware** — actions (add/remove/reorder) are tracked for later review.
4. **Metadata-driven** — track info (BPM, key, energy, transition notes) powers intelligent flow.
5. **Designed for two DJs** — roles and permissions are simple, personal, and fast.

## 🧩 MVP Goals (Phase 1)

Deliver a working prototype that allows two DJs to collaboratively plan a set in real time.

### ✅ Functional Goals

| Feature                  | Description                        | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Room Creation & Join** | Create a shared workspace (“room”) | - `/create` endpoint creates new room with unique ID<br>- URL join link works from another browser |
| **Playlist Management**  | Add, remove, reorder tracks        | - DJs can add track (title, artist, BPM, key)<br>- Drag & drop reordering updates instantly        |
| **Realtime Sync**        | WebSocket live updates             | - Second client sees updates within 500ms<br>- Reconnect resumes latest state                      |
| **Track Metadata**       | Support BPM, key, notes            | - DJs can view/edit metadata fields<br>- Changes are persisted                                     |
| **Transition Notes**     | Add per-track notes                | - Notes are synced and editable                                                                    |
| **Simple Roles**         | DJ1 (owner) & DJ2 (collaborator)   | - Owner can invite<br>- Collaborator can edit playlist                                             |
| **Persistence**          | Store data in Postgres             | - Playlist state survives page reload                                                              |
| **Export Set**           | Export to CSV                      | - “Export” button downloads ordered playlist with metadata                                         |

## 🚫 Non-Goals (MVP)

- No Spotify/SoundCloud integration (later phase)
- No complex authentication (simple session or token-based join)
- No offline mode
- No AI track suggestions yet

## 🔁 Core Flows

### 1. Create Room

- User hits “Create Room” → POST `/api/rooms`
- Server returns room ID and join link
- Client redirects to `/rooms/:id`

### 2. Join Room

- Second user opens link
- Joins WebSocket channel `room:<id>`
- Receives full playlist state on connect

### 3. Modify Playlist

- User adds / reorders / removes track
- Emits WebSocket event (`playlist:update`)
- Server validates + broadcasts delta

### 4. Export Set

- Client requests `/api/rooms/:id/export`
- Server returns CSV with track order + metadata

## ⚙️ WebSocket Event Model

| Direction | Event                  | Payload             | Description           |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| → Server  | `room:join`            | `{ roomId, user }`  | Join room             |
| → Server  | `playlist:add-track`   | `{ track }`         | Add new track         |
| → Server  | `playlist:reorder`     | `{ from, to }`      | Reorder track         |
| → Server  | `playlist:update-note` | `{ trackId, note }` | Update notes          |
| ← Client  | `playlist:state`       | `{ tracks: [...] }` | Full playlist sync    |
| ← Client  | `playlist:track-added` | `{ track }`         | Notify new track      |
| ← Client  | `playlist:updated`     | `{ delta }`         | Incremental updates   |
| ← Client  | `user:joined`          | `{ name }`          | Show presence updates |

## 🧪 Test Scenarios (for Claude to validate)

1. Two users join same room → both see same track list.
2. DJ1 adds track → DJ2 sees instantly.
3. DJ2 reorders track → both lists update correctly.
4. DJ1 adds note → syncs correctly.
5. Refresh → playlist reloaded from DB.
6. Invalid payload → error event emitted (no crash).
7. Export → valid CSV downloaded.

---

## 🧱 Development Philosophy

- Ship small, testable vertical slices.
- Prioritize clarity over completeness.
- Ask Claude for diffs and minimal patches.
- Refactor only when needed to support new features.
- Keep `PLAN.md` updated as scope evolves.

---

## 🧭 Quick Next Steps

1. Initialize repo and basic folder structure.
2. Implement Room + Track models (in-memory or Postgres).
3. Add REST endpoints: `/rooms`, `/rooms/:id/tracks`.
4. Implement WebSocket join + add-track events.
5. Create React client with real-time playlist view.
6. Add CSV export button.

Once MVP is working → add notes + simple roles.

---

**Summary:**  
`PLAN.md` defines the _what and when_ for the Listener MVP — enabling Claude Code and contributors to move step-by-step toward a working collaborative DJ set planner that feels alive, fast, and fun.
