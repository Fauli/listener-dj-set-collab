## Project: Listener ‚Äî Collaborative Real-Time DJ Playlist Tool

### üéß Vision

Listener is a **real-time collaborative DJ set planner** for DJs who want to prepare their sets together remotely.  
Two DJs can connect, share their music ideas, and build a cohesive set ‚Äî track by track ‚Äî in sync.  
They can reorder tracks, annotate transitions, add cue points, and see all changes live.

The goal: make collaborative DJ planning as natural and dynamic as performing together.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

1. **Real-time collaboration** ‚Äî every update is instantly visible to all participants.
2. **Simplicity first** ‚Äî no playback, no file uploads, just efficient planning.
3. **History-aware** ‚Äî actions (add/remove/reorder) are tracked for later review.
4. **Metadata-driven** ‚Äî track info (BPM, key, energy, transition notes) powers intelligent flow.
5. **Designed for two DJs** ‚Äî roles and permissions are simple, personal, and fast.

## üß© MVP Goals (Phase 1)

Deliver a working prototype that allows two DJs to collaboratively plan a set in real time.

### ‚úÖ Functional Goals

| Feature                  | Description                        | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Room Creation & Join** | Create a shared workspace (‚Äúroom‚Äù) | - `/create` endpoint creates new room with unique ID<br>- URL join link works from another browser |
| **Playlist Management**  | Add, remove, reorder tracks        | - DJs can add track (title, artist, BPM, key)<br>- Drag & drop reordering updates instantly        |
| **Realtime Sync**        | WebSocket live updates             | - Second client sees updates within 500ms<br>- Reconnect resumes latest state                      |
| **Track Metadata**       | Support BPM, key, notes            | - DJs can view/edit metadata fields<br>- Changes are persisted                                     |
| **Transition Notes**     | Add per-track notes                | - Notes are synced and editable                                                                    |
| **Simple Roles**         | DJ1 (owner) & DJ2 (collaborator)   | - Owner can invite<br>- Collaborator can edit playlist                                             |
| **Persistence**          | Store data in Postgres             | - Playlist state survives page reload                                                              |
| **Export Set**           | Export to CSV                      | - ‚ÄúExport‚Äù button downloads ordered playlist with metadata                                         |

## üö´ Non-Goals (MVP)

- No Spotify/SoundCloud integration (later phase)
- No complex authentication (simple session or token-based join)
- No offline mode
- No AI track suggestions yet

## üîÅ Core Flows

### 1. Create Room

- User hits ‚ÄúCreate Room‚Äù ‚Üí POST `/api/rooms`
- Server returns room ID and join link
- Client redirects to `/rooms/:id`

### 2. Join Room

- Second user opens link
- Joins WebSocket channel `room:<id>`
- Receives full playlist state on connect

### 3. Modify Playlist

- User adds / reorders / removes track
- Emits WebSocket event (`playlist:update`)
- Server validates + broadcasts delta

### 4. Export Set

- Client requests `/api/rooms/:id/export`
- Server returns CSV with track order + metadata

| --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| ‚Üí Server  | `room:join`            | `{ roomId, user }`  | Join room             |
| ‚Üí Server  | `playlist:add-track`   | `{ track }`         | Add new track         |
| ‚Üí Server  | `playlist:reorder`     | `{ from, to }`      | Reorder track         |
| ‚Üí Server  | `playlist:update-note` | `{ trackId, note }` | Update notes          |
| ‚Üê Client  | `playlist:state`       | `{ tracks: [...] }` | Full playlist sync    |
| ‚Üê Client  | `playlist:track-added` | `{ track }`         | Notify new track      |
| ‚Üê Client  | `playlist:updated`     | `{ delta }`         | Incremental updates   |
| ‚Üê Client  | `user:joined`          | `{ name }`          | Show presence updates |

## üß™ Test Scenarios (for Claude to validate)

1. Two users join same room ‚Üí both see same track list.
2. DJ1 adds track ‚Üí DJ2 sees instantly.
3. DJ2 reorders track ‚Üí both lists update correctly.
4. DJ1 adds note ‚Üí syncs correctly.
5. Refresh ‚Üí playlist reloaded from DB.
6. Invalid payload ‚Üí error event emitted (no crash).
7. Export ‚Üí valid CSV downloaded.

## üß± Development Philosophy

- Ship small, testable vertical slices.
- Prioritize clarity over completeness.
- Ask Claude for diffs and minimal patches.
- Refactor only when needed to support new features.
- Keep `PLAN.md` updated as scope evolves.

---

## üß≠ Quick Next Steps

1. Initialize repo and basic folder structure.
2. Implement Room + Track models (in-memory or Postgres).
3. Add REST endpoints: `/rooms`, `/rooms/:id/tracks`.
4. Implement WebSocket join + add-track events.
5. Create React client with real-time playlist view.
6. Add CSV export button.

Once MVP is working ‚Üí add notes + simple roles.

**Summary:**  
`PLAN.md` defines the _what and when_ for the Listener MVP ‚Äî enabling Claude Code and contributors to move step-by-step toward a working collaborative DJ set planner that feels alive, fast, and fun.
