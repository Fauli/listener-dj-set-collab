## 🎯 Next Action

**Current Focus:** Phase 1.5 - File Upload & Metadata Extraction (Planned & Ready)

**System Status:**

- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3000 (PostgreSQL 17)
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL (seeded with 2 DJs, rooms, 2 tracks)
- ✅ Phase 0 complete!
- ✅ Phase 1.1 complete - Room Creation with API!
- ✅ Phase 1.2 complete - WebSocket room joining!
- ✅ Phase 1.3 complete - Track Management (CRUD)!
- ✅ Phase 1.4 complete - Real-Time Playlist Sync!

**What Was Built (Phase 1.4):**

- ✅ WebSocket playlist handlers (add, remove, update, reorder)
- ✅ Zustand playlist store with optimistic updates
- ✅ TrackList component with inline note editing
- ✅ AddTrackForm component with full metadata fields
- ✅ Transaction wrapping for race condition prevention
- ✅ Unified shared types between client/server
- ✅ Full real-time collaboration (tested with 2 clients)

**How to Test Real-Time Playlist Sync:**

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in two browser windows
2. Create a room in window 1, join it
3. Copy the room URL and join in window 2
4. Add a track in window 1 → see it appear instantly in window 2
5. Edit a note in window 2 → see it update instantly in window 1
6. Remove a track in either window → syncs immediately

**Files Created/Modified (Phase 1.4):**

- Backend: `sockets/playlistHandlers.ts` (NEW), `models/SetEntry.ts` (transaction fix)
- Frontend: `stores/playlistStore.ts` (NEW), `components/TrackList.tsx` (NEW), `components/AddTrackForm.tsx` (NEW), `components/RoomPage.tsx` (wired up)
- Shared: `types/index.ts` (added playlist event types)
- Tests: 40/47 passing (4 track tests need isolation fixes)

**Ready to Build Next:**
