- **Impact:** Users see different track orders after reloading
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Add multiple tracks to playlist quickly
  2. Observe order
  3. Reload room
  4. Order is different
- **Root Cause:** Likely race condition in position management or incorrect ordering query
- **Location:** `src/server/models/SetEntry.ts` (addTrackToPlaylist) or `src/client/stores/playlistStore.ts`
- **Priority:** P0 - Fix before any other work

**BUG #1: Reordering fails with unique constraint error**

- **Severity:** HIGH (breaks core feature intermittently)
- **Impact:** Users cannot reliably reorder tracks

  ```
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Add 3+ tracks to playlist
  2. Drag track to reorder multiple times quickly
  3. Error appears inconsistently
- **Root Cause:** Race condition in updatePosition transaction - temporary position -1 may conflict
- **Location:** `src/server/models/SetEntry.ts:224` (updatePosition function)
- **Priority:** P0 - Fix after Bug #5

### Priority 2: Core DJ Functionality Issues

**BUG #2: Zoomed Waveform beat grid doesn't adapt to tempo changes**

- **Severity:** HIGH (marked as "drastic" by user)

- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Load track with beat grid set
  2. Change tempo knob
  3. Beat grid calculations update but waveform markers don't move
- **Root Cause:** Beat grid overlay not recalculating positions when rate changes
- **Location:** `src/client/components/Waveform.tsx` and `src/client/components/ZoomedWaveform.tsx`
- **Priority:** P1 - Critical for DJ functionality

**BUG #6: Deleting track doesn't update playlist until reload**

- **Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Impact:** Real-time sync broken, confusing UX
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Have 2+ clients in same room
  2. Delete track in one client
  3. Track remains visible in other clients until page reload
- **Root Cause:** WebSocket event not broadcasting or client not handling playlist:track-removed
- **Location:** `src/server/sockets/playlistHandlers.ts` or `src/client/stores/playlistStore.ts`
- **Priority:** P1

### Priority 3: State Management & UX Issues

**BUG #4: Old tracks remain in decks when switching rooms**

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** Confusing UX, old audio may play in new room
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Load tracks in Deck A & B in Room 1
  2. Navigate to Room 2
  3. Old tracks still loaded in decks
- **Root Cause:** Deck store not cleared on room change
- **Location:** `src/client/stores/deckStore.ts` - needs cleanup on room unmount
- **Priority:** P2

**BUG #3: Room creation shows backend URL instead of frontend URL**

- **Severity:** LOW
- **Impact:** Copy-paste URL doesn't work, user confusion
- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Create new room
  2. Check "Room Created" success message
  3. URL shows `http://localhost:3000/rooms/...` instead of `http://localhost:5173/rooms/...`
- **Root Cause:** Frontend constructing URL incorrectly
- **Location:** `src/client/components/RoomCreate.tsx`
- **Priority:** P3 - Easy fix, low impact

**BUG #7: Cue points not loading after room reload (TESTING)**

- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Impact:** Cue points don't persist across sessions
- **Status:** Fix implemented, needs user testing

2. Review `addTrackToPlaylist()` - check if position conflicts cause wrong ordering
3. Add logging to track position assignments during multiple rapid uploads
4. Check WebSocket event ordering - verify `playlist:track-added` events maintain order

**Files to Check:**

- `src/server/models/SetEntry.ts` (lines 100-114: getPlaylistByRoom, lines 33-95: addTrackToPlaylist)
- `src/client/stores/playlistStore.ts` (WebSocket event handlers)
- `src/server/sockets/playlistHandlers.ts` (track-added event broadcasting)

**Expected Fix:** Ensure consistent ordering query and handle position conflicts correctly

**Test Plan:**

1. Upload 5 tracks rapidly via drag-and-drop
2. Note positions in UI
3. Reload page
4. Verify positions match original order
5. Test in 2 browser windows simultaneously

#### 2. FIX BUG #1: Reordering Unique Constraint Error (P0 - HIGH) 🔴

**Problem:** Drag & drop reordering fails with unique constraint error

**Root Cause:** Transaction in `updatePosition()` uses temporary position `-1`, which can conflict if multiple entries exist or concurrent reorders happen

**Proposed Solution:**

- Use a unique temporary position: `-(Date.now() + Math.random())` instead of `-1`
- Or use a transaction isolation level that prevents conflicts
- Or restructure to swap positions directly without temp position

**Files to Check:**

- `src/server/models/SetEntry.ts:193-264` (updatePosition function, line 218 sets position: -1)

**Test Plan:**

1. Add 5+ tracks to playlist
2. Rapidly drag tracks to different positions multiple times
3. Verify no errors in console
4. Test with 2 users reordering simultaneously

---

#### 3. FIX BUG #2: Beat Grid Waveform Not Updating with Tempo (P1 - HIGH) 🟡

**Problem:** When tempo changes, beat calculations update but waveform beat markers stay in old positions

**Root Cause:** Waveform component not re-rendering beat markers when `rate` prop changes

**Proposed Solution:**

- Add `rate` to useEffect dependencies in Waveform.tsx and ZoomedWaveform.tsx
- Recalculate beat marker positions when rate changes
- Clear and redraw beat grid overlay

**Files to Check:**

- `src/client/components/Waveform.tsx` (beat grid rendering logic)
- `src/client/components/ZoomedWaveform.tsx` (beat grid rendering logic)
- Look for `useEffect` hooks that draw beat markers

**Test Plan:**

1. Load track and set beat grid
2. Verify beat markers align with audio
3. Change tempo from 1.0 to 1.05
4. Verify beat markers shift to remain aligned
5. Test at extreme values (0.92 and 1.08)

---

#### 4. FIX BUG #6: Delete Not Syncing in Real-Time (P1 - MEDIUM-HIGH) 🟡

**Problem:** Deleting a track in one client doesn't update other clients until page reload

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Check if `playlist:track-removed` event is being emitted in backend
2. Verify WebSocket event is being received in frontend
3. Check if `playlistStore` is handling the event correctly
4. Verify `removeTrack` action in store is being called

**Files to Check:**

- `src/server/sockets/playlistHandlers.ts` (check for track removal broadcasting)
- `src/client/stores/playlistStore.ts` (check event listener for track-removed)
- `src/client/components/TrackList.tsx` (delete button implementation)

**Test Plan:**

1. Open 2 browser windows in same room
2. Add 3 tracks to playlist
3. Delete middle track in window 1
4. Verify track disappears immediately in window 2
5. Verify positions renumber correctly

### 🎯 After Bug Fixes: Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)

Once critical bugs are resolved, tackle these improvements:

1. **IMP #4: Exact BPM Display** (1-2 hours)
   - Show "Current BPM: 128.47" below tempo knob
   - Formula: `originalBPM × rate`
   - Update in real-time

2. **IMP #3: Vertical Grid Box Alignment** (1-2 hours)
   - Rearrange BeatGridControl to use less vertical space
   - Free up screen real estate for waveforms

3. **BUG #3: Fix Room URL Display** (30 minutes)
   - Change `http://localhost:3000` to `http://localhost:5173` in RoomCreate.tsx
   - Or use `window.location.origin` dynamically

4. **BUG #4: Clear Deck on Room Change** (1 hour)
   - Add cleanup in RoomPage component's `useEffect` unmount
   - Call `deckStore.reset('A')` and `deckStore.reset('B')`

### 📋 What Was Built in Phase 1.7 (DJ Player Features)

**Audio Playback:**

- Dual-deck player (Deck A & B) with independent controls
- WaveSurfer.js integration for waveform visualization
- Transport controls: play, pause, stop, seek
- Volume, loop, tempo (±8%), 3-band EQ controls
- Knob components for all parameters

**Beat Grid & Cue Points:**

- Manual beat grid setting with visual markers on waveform
- 4 cue points per track (Start, End, A, B)
- Beat-snapped cue points when grid is active
- Cue point persistence in database (JSON field)
- Delete cue points via Shift+Click or Right-Click

**Waveform Visualization:**

- Full overview waveform (entire track)
- Zoomed waveform (20-second window around playhead)
- Beat markers overlay
- Cue point markers
- Click-to-seek on waveform
- Color-coded by deck (blue/purple)

**Track Selection:**

- Modal to load tracks from playlist to deck
- Load/unload buttons
- Track metadata display (title, artist, BPM, key)

**Files Created:**

- `src/client/components/DeckPlayer.tsx` (main deck component)
- `src/client/components/Waveform.tsx` (full waveform view)

## 📌 Summary & Recommendations

### What's Been Accomplished

**Phase 1 is COMPLETE!** All core features have been implemented:

- ✅ Room creation and joining with WebSocket real-time sync
- ✅ Track management (CRUD) with file upload and metadata extraction
- ✅ Real-time playlist sync across multiple DJs
- ✅ Drag & drop reordering
- ✅ **BONUS:** Full dual-deck DJ player with waveforms, beat grids, cue points, and EQ

The project has evolved from a simple playlist manager into a **feature-rich DJ application** with professional audio controls.

### Critical Path Forward

**⚠️ STOP BEFORE PHASE 2** - There are critical bugs that affect data integrity and core functionality:

**MUST FIX FIRST (P0):**

1. **BUG #5** - Random track order (data integrity issue)
2. **BUG #1** - Reordering constraint error (breaks feature)

**SHOULD FIX NEXT (P1):** 3. **BUG #2** - Beat grid waveform not updating (DJ workflow blocker) 4. **BUG #6** - Delete not syncing (real-time sync broken)

**CAN FIX LATER (P2-P3):** 5. **BUG #4** - Old tracks in deck (state management) 6. **BUG #3** - Wrong URL display (cosmetic) 7. **BUG #7** - Cue points loading (fix applied, needs testing)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix BUG #5 and BUG #1** - These affect core functionality and data integrity
2. **Fix BUG #2 and BUG #6** - These affect DJ workflow and real-time features
3. **Quick wins** - Fix bugs #3 and #4 (under 2 hours total)
4. **Add improvements #4 and #5** - Exact BPM display and sync button (high value for DJs)
5. **Then proceed to Phase 2** - Polish, authentication, and deployment

### Testing Gaps

- Only 48/55 backend tests passing (87%)
- **Zero tests** for Phase 1.7 DJ player features
- No E2E tests for critical user flows
- Manual testing only for WebSocket sync

**Recommendation:** Add test coverage during bug fix sprint to prevent regressions.

### Acknowledgments

**Feature #2 from improvement requests is ALREADY DONE!**

- Delete cue points with Shift+Click or Right-Click
- May need better UI hints/tooltips to make this discoverable
