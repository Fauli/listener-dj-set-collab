## 🎯 Next Action

**Current Focus:** Phase 1.3 - Track Management (CRUD)

**System Status:**

- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3000 (PostgreSQL 17)
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Database: PostgreSQL (seeded with 2 DJs, rooms, 2 tracks)
- ✅ Phase 0 complete!
- ✅ Phase 1.1 complete - Room Creation with API!
- ✅ Phase 1.2 complete - WebSocket room joining!

**What Was Built (Phase 1.2):**

- ✅ Session model service for tracking active users
- ✅ WebSocket room handlers (join, disconnect)
- ✅ Socket.io event handlers on server
- ✅ Frontend socket service with typed events
- ✅ RoomPage component with real-time presence
- ✅ React Router v7 integration (/, /rooms/:id)
- ✅ User presence indicators (green pulse animation)

**How to Test Multi-Client Join:**

1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Enter a room name and click "Create Room"
3. Click "Join Room" to enter the room
4. Open the room link in a new incognito/private window
5. You should see both users listed in the "Active Users" panel
6. Close one tab - the user should disappear from the list

**Files Created/Modified (Phase 1.2):**

- Backend: `models/Session.ts`, `sockets/roomHandlers.ts`, `index.ts`
- Frontend: `services/socket.ts`, `components/RoomPage.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `vite-env.d.ts`
- Tests: Still 15/15 passing

**Ready to Build Next:**
Phase 1.3: Track Management (CRUD operations for adding/removing tracks)
